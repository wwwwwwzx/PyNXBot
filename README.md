## Usage
Use [CaptureSight](https://github.com/zaksabeast/CaptureSight/)/CheckDen script to check your Den id

Raid Finder:
1) Install the latest release of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) Connect your Switch to Internet
3) Start sys-botbase and ldn_mitm
4) Go to System Settings, check your Switch IP and write it inside config.json file
5) Start the game and set game text speed to normal
6) Save in front of an empty Den and leave the game opened. You must have at least one Wishing Piece in your bag
7) Modify research filters inside the script according to what is written below
8) Run the script

* r.ShinyType == 'None'/'Star'/'Square' (!= 'None' for both Square/Star shiny type)
* Util.STRINGS.natures[r.Nature] == 'Nature' (i.e. Util.STRINGS.natures[r.Nature] == 'Timid')
* r.Ability == 1/2/'H'
* r.IVs == spread_name (spread_name = [x,x,x,x,x,x])

Stars Finder:
1) Install the latest release of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2) Connect your Switch to Internet
2) Start sys-botbase, ldn_mitm and luxray (the yellow cursor of luxray has to be over "+3" button)
3) Go to System Settings, check your Switch IP and write it inside config.json file
4) Start the game, save in front of an Den whose beam has been generated through a Wishing Piece and leave the game opened
5) Run the script

### GUI in Python: NXController

This is a port from C++, please check more details from [my prior project](https://github.com/wwwwwwzx/NXController).
1) Install the latest release of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install PyQt5 via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):
`pip install pyqt5`
2) Connect your Switch to Internet or Arduino
3) Go to System Settings, check your Switch IP
4) Run the script. The Qt Gui will pop up.

You may change the button setting by editing the json file accoring to [this website](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#Key-enum). Please note that only decimal numbers are allowed in json.

## Features for fun
Use the binaries and structures from your browsers (iOS, Android): [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wwwwwwzx/PyNXBot/master?urlpath=lab/tree/test.ipynb). You may have to expose your switch to the internet.

## Always Remember!
Sometimes button inputs of your joycons won't work. This because the fake controller isn't detached from your Switch. 
So, everytime you want to stop the bot, always press CTRL+C and follow the instructions. The bot will detach the fake controller and buttons will work correctly.
